# Redux Feedback Loop

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Sprint_

This Material-UI enhanced web based 'Feedback' survey tool is a great way to collect daily feedback for institutions, clubs, or the like.  This application features an Admin portal to see all feedback, and remove feedback as necessary.  For demonstration purposes, the Admin poortal is avialable to the user from the main page.  The application collect 3 data points scoring from 1 to 5, and then one verbose comment.   It allows the user to verify the feedback, and return to correct the feedback if they desire.  Finally it allows the user to submit the feedback to the backend database for non-volatile storage.
